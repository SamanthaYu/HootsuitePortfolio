				<h5> About Samantha Yu </h5> <hr>
				<p>
					Dear Sir or Madam,
				</p><br>
				
				<p>
					Please accept my application for the <b>Dogwood Award</b> for <b>Applied Skills</b> in <b>Computer Programming</b>.  Over the past few years, I have learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java.  I am intrigued by the idea that I can potentially create both real and imaginary constructs and solve complex problems using software.  Due to my fascination with software technology, I plan to major in Computer Science at either the University of British Columbia or Simon Fraser University.  By pursuing further study in a rigorous and in depth university program, it is my expectation and hope to explore the various fields of computer science to narrow down my career choice.
				</p><br>
				
				<p>
					For my ICT: Modular Survey 11 class, I designed a significant portion of the <b><a href="http://aagprovincials.surreychristian.com/" target="_blank">Senior Girls' Volleyball Provincials' website</a></b>.  As part of the design team, I was responsible for not only editing my peers' code, but also for designing the overall layout of the website.  I also added user friendly features such as the drop-down menu bar, footer menu, and the home page's slideshow.  As a result of this extensive web design, I have been hired to create a couple of websites for a professional mediator and violinist.
				</p><br>
				
				<p>
					During this same computer class, I designed a <b><a href="blackjack.html">Blackjack</a></b> game using JavaScript.  My version of this classic game had an unconventional use of monetary funds to add another dimension to the traditional gameplay.  The player decides on the size of his bet by selecting one of the pre-determined values, going all in, or entering in his own amount.  After a certain number of rounds or when the player has lost all his money, the game ends and the player is given the option to restart.
				</p><br>
				
				<p>
					For my online AP Computer Science 12 class, I created a <b><a href="paint.html">Paint Program</a></b> using Java.  In order to implement my own ideas for this program, I thoroughly researched the Java documentation on topics that had not been introduced in the course.  Since this paint program was built around the idea of double buffering, I had to change how this concept was implemented when I introduced the aspect of layers.  Although I have already completed this course, I am still improving my paint program and I plan to add an eraser tool and an undo button.
				</p><br>
				
				<p>
					Thank you for considering my application for the Dogwood Award in Applied Skills for Computer Programming.
				</p><br>
				
				<p>
					Sincerely,
				</p><br><br>

				<p>
					Samantha Yu
